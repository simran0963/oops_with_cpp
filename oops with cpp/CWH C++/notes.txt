Programming With C++
* Bjarne Stroustrup, 1979
* Very close to Hardware, direcly instructs the hardware
* Object Oriented programming
* Extension of C
* Fast program
* More control over system resources
* Memory Management
* High performance
* 2011 - C++ 11
* 2014 - C++ 14
* 2017 - C++ 17
* variable : containers to store data
* comments : ignore this line or set of text, doesn't execute
* Based on scope: 1. Local variables(local scope) 2. Global variables(global scope)
* Scope : scope of a variable is the region where the existence of variable is valid
* Data types : 1. Built-in 2. User defined 3. Derived
	1, int, float, char, double, bool
	2. struct, union, enum
	3. array, function, pointer
* Local variable has high precedence over global variables
* Constants : const keyword is used for the same, when we don't wish to change a value        until the program ends.
*Manipulators : <iomanip> header file : endl, setw
*Operator precedence : if precedence is same, associativity is checked.
* Control Structures : 
	1. Sequence structure    2. Selection structure     3. Loop structure
	1. start->action1->act2->act3->end
	2. start->condition checked->loop block executed->exit
	3. start->var init->condition checked->block executed until condition false->var increamented->exit
* Looping : 1. for 2. while 3. do while
	1.
